"Insight provides vision, action creates reality"

John Taylor is an Advisor and Personal Coach for CEOs, Founders, and individuals who want evolutionary relationships and peak performance, and for executives and business owners who want to expand their success and impact in the world, while living fully actualized lives.

He serves on the executive board of Richard Branson's Galactic Unite (www.galacticunite.org/), part of Virgin Unite (http://www.virgin.com/unite), which is dedicated to inspiring youth in the fields of science, technology, math, engineering, and business entrepreneurship (STEM+).

A systems thinker, with degrees in Physics and Engineering and broad experience creating results in challenging environments, he brings efficiency and speed to uncovering and removing existing issues and limitations in individuals and teams, and accelerates them into being effective, success-oriented, and results-generating. Based in the Bay Area, John has advised dozens of technology and consumer-product start-ups, and maintains a robust network and "bench" of A-level resources and expertise.

As a speaker on leadership, the new masculinity, and what it means to be "Alpha Awakened," he is a regular contributor to business and cultural programs, and forums for personal evolution.

He has been recognized by the Consulate General of the United States for his humanitarian work in Ecuador, and supports multiple environmental and social non-profits.
